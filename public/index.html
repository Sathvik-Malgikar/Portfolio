          I am a passionate learner and coding enthusiast! I love solving
          problems and creating projects. I am always happy to utilize my
          skillset and framework knowledge to brainstorm and come up with
          solutions. I have worked on team projects in different hackathons and
          coding competitions. I am familiar with domains like web and app
          development, creating desktop applications, developing efficient
          algorithms.I am fluent in both front and backend frameworks like react
          js , mongodb , node js, express js. I have made simple platformer 2d
          games in unity engines and know a thing or two about game logic.
